 RESPONSIVE GRID by Matt Ward
 
 Yes, it's true. The last thing the development community needs is another responsive grid. I get that.
 Fortunately, this project is not intended for wide usage. It is a personal project that I am using
 to dig deeper into SASS and Compass, experimenting in a number of different areas.

/* Import Compass Modules */

@import "compass/css3";

/* Import custom functions and mixins for this project */
@import "_00_functions.scss";

/* Import the reset stylesheet */
@import "_01_reset.scss";

/* Import the basic variables  to be used through the other sheets  */
@import "_02_vars.scss";

/* Import base styles -- styles that are not applied with classes at all  */
@import "_03_base.scss";

/* Import styles for defining typography  */
@import "_04_typography.scss";

/* Import styles for defining the layout -- this is where the responsive magic happens */
@import "_05_layout.scss";

/* Import styles for presentation -- the nitty-gritty bits to make the site look sensational  */
@import "_06_presentation.scss";
